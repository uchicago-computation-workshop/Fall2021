**Summary:** Are two heads better than one, or do too many cooks spoil the broth? Although researchers have generated a large number of nuanced answers to this question, they have had little success specifying the range of conditions for which a given answer applies. I argue that one of the keys to solving the puzzle is to better understand the underlying nature of the tasks being performed. Because no clear language exists to describe tasks in a way that allows for straightforward comparisons across studies, the role of task characteristics remains poorly understood. I will present an idea for developing a comprehensive, empirically grounded theory of group tasks using high-throughput, adaptive experiment design.

**Abdullah Almaatouq** is a computational social scientist. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Abdullah is the Douglas Drane Career Professor, an assistant professor in the Sloan School of Management, and affiliated faculty at the Center for Computational Engineering and Connection Science Research Initiative. 

Abdullahâ€™s research lies at the intersection of computer science and human behavior, with a focus on collective intelligence and large-scale experimentation. His current work centers on questions related to whether and, if so, under what conditions groups exhibit superior performance outcomes relative to individuals. As he pursues his research, Abdullah is regularly presented with challenges that prompt him to innovate in experimental design and data analysis. This includes creating Empirica, a virtual lab platform for developing and conducting synchronous and high-throughput human-participant experiments.

Abdullah holds a PhD in Computational Science and Engineering and a dual masters from MIT. Before that, he received his undergraduate degree from Southampton University, United Kingdom.
