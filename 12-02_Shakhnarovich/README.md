**Summary:** We will look at the problem of identifying meaningful changes in sequences of images, both as a detection problem (find when the change occurs) and a description problem (describe the nature of the change in natural language). I will discuss our recent work on these problems (joint with Davis Gilton, Ruotian Luo and Rebecca Willett) in which we show that tackling them jointly may be beneficial.
