## The Computation Workshop Presents

# Fall Welcome Mixer

The [Computation Workshop](https://macss.uchicago.edu/content/computation-workshop) at the University of Chicago cordially invites you to attend this week's event. We welcome the new class of MACSS students, greet our returning second year's, and invite all faculty and guests to mingle with our students, discuss big ideas, and celebrate the first Computation Workshop of the academic year. 

### Thursday, 10/01/2020 
### 11:20am-12:40pm 

Via Zoom

---
Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Fall2020/issues/1"> issues page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository on GitHub.</a></p>

**Before the Fall Welcome Mixer**, by Wednesday, September 30 @ 11:59pm each of you will:

- Think about whom and what you'd like to see at our workshop over the coming academic year, and **suggest at least one speaker or one paper, and an explanation of why** that speaker or *some speaker* from that paper would be desirable visitors to the computational social science workshop at the University of Chicago. For example, they may have developed a powerful new method, or analyze the social world in a new way, or discover new social facts or processes, or develop a new socially relevant technology, or be an amazing speaker (e.g., link to a YouTube presentation). No one is off limits; although not all will come if and when we invite them (but many will). You may submit more than one speaker or paper, but make sure to add each as a separate response to the issues page (e.g., so that when people upvote it...see below, we will know what they are upvoting!) 

- Then, upvote (“thumbs up”) **at least 5** proposals from other people. Upvote recommendations you like (not comments from people you are friends with ;-). 

At the Mixer we will discuss the top upvoted recommendations, introduce you to the format of the workshop and present an analysis of what we do, how we do it, and how we could do it better!

**Registration**: The meeting will be held virtually on Zoom. For security purposes, please register through this [link]( https://uchicago.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcocu2rqz0tHdwcMfhObnl-5uuyvPRM6Z11) to request access. Only accounts affiliated with the University of Chicago will be granted access.

Our own MCSS faculty member, Jon Clindaniel, will present his work during the following workshop on October 8.
