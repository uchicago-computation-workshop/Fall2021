**Summary:** Social computing is ubiquitous and intensifying in the 21st Century. Originally used to reference computational augmentation of social interaction through collaborative filtering, social media, wikis, and crowdsourcing, here I propose to expand the concept to cover the complete dynamic interface between social interaction and computation, including computationally enhanced sociality and social science, socially enhanced computing and computer science, and their increasingly complex combination for mutual enhancement. This recommends that we reimagine Computational Social Science as Social Computing, not merely using computational tools to make sense of the contemporary explosion of social data, but also recognizing societies as emergent computers of more or less collective intelligence, innovation and flourishing. It further proposes we imagine a socially inspired computer science that takes these insights into account as we build machines not merely to substitute for human cognition, but radically complement it. This leads to a vision of social computing as an extreme form of human computer interaction, whereby machines and persons recursively combine to augment one another in generating collective intelligence, enhanced knowledge, and other social goods unattainable without each other. Using the example of science and technology, I illustrate how progress in each of these areas unleash advances in the others and the beneficial relationship between the technology and science of social computing, which reveals limits of sociality and computation, and stimulates our imagination about how they can reach past those limits together.

**Attendance**: The presentation will be held in Rm 142 of 1155 East 60th St. MACSS students who have a last name starting with A through L (Group 1) are required to attend this week's presentation in-person. The rest of MACSS students (Group 2) and all other attendees will need to join the meeting via Zoom. Students in Group 2 are expected to show up in-person next week.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues <a href= "https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Fall2021/issues/1"> page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository.</a>

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, September 29 @ 11:59pm each of you will:

- Think about whom and what you'd like to see at our workshop over the coming academic year, and **suggest at least one speaker or one paper, and an explanation of why** that speaker or *some speaker* from that paper would be desirable visitors to the computational social science workshop at the University of Chicago. For example, they may have developed a powerful new method, or analyze the social world in a new way, or discover new social facts or processes, or develop a new socially relevant technology, or be an amazing speaker (e.g., link to a YouTube presentation). No one is off limits; although not all will come if and when we invite them (but many will). You may submit more than one speaker or paper, but make sure to add each as a separate response to the issues page (e.g., so that when people upvote it...see below, we will know what they are upvoting!) 

- Then by Thursday, Sep 30 @ 10:59am, upvote (“thumbs up”) **at least 5** questions and proposals from other people. Upvote questions and recommendations you like (not comments from people you are friends with ;-).
