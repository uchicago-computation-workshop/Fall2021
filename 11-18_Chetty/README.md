**Summary:** Shopping online? Find yourself asking: are there really only 3 items left at this price? In some cases, the answer is that it is a downright lie or at best misleading in nature. Yet, it is not always easy to recognize this kind of content or the effect it has on consumers. In the shopping example, consumers may not realize they are being duped into making purchasing decisions they may not have, if fully informed and presented with accurate information. To keep up with this increasing trend towards intentionally misleading user interface choices, or dark patterns, which steer consumers down certain paths for the gain of the service provider, policy-makers are creating, discussing, and reviewing current regulations for online content. In this talk, I present two case studies of misleading online content and the current consumer protections in place to prevent users from being harmed in the US: disguised advertisements and dark patterns used in shopping websites. I will provide evidence about the prevalence of these issues on the web, how users perceive them, and discuss what kinds of solutions can be put into place to help consumers become aware of and be protected from unfair and unjust practices that rely on misleading premises. To conclude, I will provide suggestions for future work for researchers, policy-makers, and designers who are invested in enhancing online consumer protections.
