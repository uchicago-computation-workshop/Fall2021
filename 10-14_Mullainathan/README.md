**Summary:** Science begins with something curiously non-scientific. Scientists meticulously test hypotheses that themselves come from a very messy place: a mix of creativity, intuition, observation and chance. We argue machine learning can play a more rigorous role here. We illustrate this in a problem that is of great conceptual and practical interest: how do judges decide whom to jail? A deep learning algorithm trained on past data discovers a striking behavioral error: a defendant's face alone accounts for 30% of the explainable variation in whom judges choose to jail. This finding is not explained by race, skin color,  demographics or other known factors. To make the discovery usable, we develop a procedure that allows the algorithm to communicate what it is seeing in the face. This leads us to identify facial features, previously not considered, that bias the way judges treat defendants.

**Sendhil Mullainathan** is the Roman Family University Professor of Computation and Behavioral Science at Chicago Booth. His current research uses machine learning to understand complex problems in human behavior, social policy, and especially medicine, where computational techniques have the potential to uncover biomedical insights from large-scale health data. He currently teaches a course on Artificial Intelligence.

In past work he has combined insights from economics and behavioral science with causal inference tools—lab, field, and natural experiments—to study social problems such as discrimination and poverty. Papers include: the impact of poverty on mental bandwidth; how algorithms can improve on judicial decision-making; whether CEO pay is excessive; using fictitious resumes to measure discrimination; showing that higher cigarette taxes makes smokers happier; and modeling how competition affects media bias.

**Attendance**: The talk will be held in Rm 295 of 1155 East 60th St. MACSS students who have a last name starting with A through L (Group 1) are required to attend this week's talk in person. Due to capacity constraint, the rest of MACSS students (Group 2) and all other attendees will need to join the meeting via Zoom ([link](https://uchicago.zoom.us/j/95981728771?pwd=SWdIcmVYeDFINmZpaldkbmsxUmN4dz09)) this week.


**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the issues <a href= https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Fall2021/issues/5> page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository.</a></p>
